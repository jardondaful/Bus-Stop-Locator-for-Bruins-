# 🚌 Bus-Stop-Locator-for-Bruins! 🐻

Welcome to our Bus-Stop-Locator-for-Bruins project! 🎉

## About the Project

We are a team of Bruins working on a Python scripted toolbox in ArcGIS Pro to locate buses within a desired proximity and suggest which ones to take and when based on current user data. 🌟

## Meet the Team 👋

## How to Use
```
To start usinng the project, download the entire .zip file and navigate to the .aprx file that is two dirctories in. 
Once you open the .aprx file, navigate to the Jupyter notebook and run each of the two tasks in order! 
If the script prompts you to type in some input for your current location and desired destination, go ahead and do so in the specified format. 
You will eventually see an output that specifies exatcly which bus stops and routes to take and how to reach them!
