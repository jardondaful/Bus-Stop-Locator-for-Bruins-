# Bus Stop Locator for Bruins üöåüêª

Welcome to the Bus Stop Locator for Bruins project! üéâ

## About the Project

The Bus Stop Locator for Bruins is a Python-scripted toolbox built in ArcGIS Pro. The purpose of this project is to help locate bus stops within a desired proximity and provide recommendations on which buses to take based on current user inputted data. As output, it generates directions on which bos stops and routes to take in terminal and generates visual layouts of such directions üåü

## Code Description

The main script (`main.py`) contains the following functions:

- `geocode_address(address, label)`: This function takes an address and a label as inputs, geocodes the address using the ArcGIS geocoding service, and retrieves its coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- `create_file_geodatabase(folder_path, gdb_name)`: This function creates a new file geodatabase at the specified folder path with the given name.
- `create_feature_dataset(gdb_path, fds_name, spatial_ref)`: This function creates a new feature dataset within the specified file geodatabase path, using the given feature dataset name and spatial reference.
- `create_public_transit_data_model(in_gtfs, fds)`: This function creates the public transit data model by converting the GTFS data into a feature dataset.
- `connect_streets_to_ptdm(ptdm_path, streets_path)`: This function connects the streets to the public transit data model.
- `create_network_dataset(template_path, ptdm_path)`: This function creates the network dataset using a template and the public transit data model.
- `build_network(network_dataset)`: This function builds the network dataset.
- `geocode_and_create_shapefile(folder_path, output_shapefile)`: This function prompts the user to enter the starting and desired addresses, geocodes them, and creates a shapefile with the locations.
- `solve_closest_facility(layer_object, stops_path, output_shapefile)`: This function solves the closest facility analysis using the network dataset and the specified stops.
- `solve_route(layer_object, stops_path)`: This function solves the route analysis using the network dataset and the specified stops.
- `generate_map_layout(project_path, layout_name, map_name, output_folder, output_filename)`: This function generates a map layout with a specified title, scale bar, and legend, and exports it as a PDF.

6. If prompted, provide your current location and desired destination in the specified format.
7. Review the output, which will provide you with bus stop recommendations and routes to take.

Please note that you may need to install the required dependencies, such as `arcpy` and `requests`, before running the script.
## How to Use

To use the Bus Stop Locator for Bruins, follow these steps:

1. Download the entire .zip file.
2. Extract the files to your desired location.
3. Locate the .aprx file within the extracted files.
4. Open the .aprx file in ArcGIS Pro.
5. In the Jupyter notebook or Python script, run each of the functions in the main script (`main.py`) in the specified order.
